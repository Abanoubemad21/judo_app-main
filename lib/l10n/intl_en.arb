   "scree5paragraph1": "The great effort placed on the player's muscles when executing physical effort requires the use of an additional amount of oxygen, and this comes with regulating the breathing process and increasing its speed, as well as the speed of blood circulation.

Nutrition for the body, and the body’s systems adapt themselves depending on the external conditions related to the player’s movements and efforts.",
   "scree5paragraph2": "Therefore, it was necessary for the athlete to gradually decline in effort and movement so that the body's internal systems, in turn, could gradually perform their functions to keep pace with the athlete's effort and movement, since the energy of the body's systems to perform their functions is limited.",
   "scree5paragraph3": "The movements and efforts must not exceed the rate of this energy so as not to cause adverse results and health and physical damage. These devices must be adequately prepared to suit the physical effort expected to be performed. This is done by doing some physical exercises and running exercises of gradual strength before starting In matches, we reach an increase in breathing speed and thus we find a large amount of oxygen in the player’s body, to help the muscles and body systems perform their function, and this prevents common sports injuries.",
   "scree5paragraph4": "But if the body's systems are no longer adequately prepared to accept the maximum effort expected to be performed, then sports injuries can occur, or the first appearance of fatigue, which is called (psychosis). This phenomenon can continue with the player, so he is unable to perform his duty on the field.' Until the internal systems are organized and prepared to accept the effort required to be performed, then the player becomes ready to carry out his duties, that is, after he obtains his second breath.",

This part of the preparation is not sufficient to qualify the player to participate in matches or the main part of training and to perform fast running movements with the ball.' Or without it and camouflage movements, as for the special warm-up, it prepares the player in all the aspects mentioned, and prepares him for all the possibilities and movements that he performs in the matches in order to avoid field injuries.",
   "scree5paragraph6": "Therefore, it was necessary for the athlete to gradually decline in effort and movement so that the body's internal systems, in turn, could gradually perform their functions to keep pace with the athlete's effort and movement, since the energy of the body's systems to perform their functions is limited.",
