There was a man named (Akiyama Oshito) from Nagasaki Province in Japan studying in China, and there he was impressed by the wrestling of the people of China, and that was in the seventh century BC, then he transferred it to his home, but China transferred it from ancient Egypt, where the ancient pharaohs practiced this type of wrestling since three thousand years BC, and then it was transferred by the Hyksos to Southeast Asia after the end of their raids and defeat by the ancient pharaohs in Egypt, where there are many drawings that resemble a lot of Judo movements now and also tying the belt on the abdomen, on the walls of Bani Hassan temples, and many ancient Pharaonic tombs.\n\n Judo is one of the typical Japanese sports with an international character or characteristic, and it contributes, being a problem of culture in itself, to bringing about friendship and peace between countries and peoples of the world in a tremendous way these days, by providing people with an area in which they can achieve fruitful exchange among themselves, and then we find that the game Judo provides help and aid to promote happiness, prosperity and well-being for all human beings, and that is the message of judo, and there is no higher goal than this goal.\n\n Many decades ago, the sport of judo was considered a sport in which only the Japanese were distinguished, but with the achievement of the international character of this sport, the performance of judo players from all over the world has clearly improved, and they have shown skill and strength when compared with non-Japanese players to outperform the Japanese judo players until They became Olympic or world champions, and their achievements show very clearly that the sport of judo is no longer a monopoly on Japan, but has become the property of the whole world, and this helps in sparking further spread and development of judo. \n\n The emergence of the sport of judo in its current form is due to Jigor Kano, who was born in 1860 AD, and learned literature and philosophy at the University of Tokyo in 1881 AD, and is considered one of the founding members of the Olympic Games in 1896 AD, and Kano took over the Ministry of Education in his country, making judo among the subjects education in schools at that time, then he died in 1938 AD - during his return trip at sea due to a sudden illness, after a meeting of the International Olympic Federation in Cairo, and Kano before his death had made great efforts in all parts of the world in order to spread the sport of judo and increase practitioners at different levels. \n\n In 1882, Jigor Kano established an international academy for teaching various judo arts in Tokyo.\n\n And Tony, Geoffrey points out that in ancient times in Japan and several centuries ago, power and strength were concentrated in the hands of the strong feudal government at the expense of the weak central government, so each ruler of a region at that time had a group of warriors and samurai fighters, who relied on them to protect the region from attacks. And external problems, so this class of people was training hard and diligently to fight by using hands, and also by using weapons. \n\n And there were specialized schools to teach these different martial arts and movements to the samurai class so that there would be those who could deter the people during the outbreak of popular revolutions and riots.\n\n Until the mid-19th century, no ordinary person could train in those martial arts; they were exclusively reserved for samurai warriors. However, a new government came into power in 1873, ending this system and relieving the samurai class of their duties, sending them into retirement. This was the main reason for the division of the people into two groups during the disturbances and revolutions. One group suppressed the riots and represented the police while the other group tried to regain their former position in the samurai class and represented the police group. When Jigoro Kano was eighteen years old in 1878, he gathered all the movements that the samurai class used to train in, which were called Jujutsu. He did this in the town of Shinorio under the supervision of two men named Fukuda and Iso, who held high positions in the Military Academy, which was completed in 1895 in Kyoto, Japan. Kano arranged and eliminated the dangerous and deadly movements, analyzed them, and identified the main points of how to teach these movements to the general public in a special school. That school was the Kodokan, which we mentioned earlier was established in 1882 in Tokyo, Japan. \n\n The Kodokan is the place where people come from all over the world for education and training, and to know everything new about the sport of Judo, because of the presence of high-level experiences from teachers and trainers who can consolidate and refine these experiences among the arrivals to the Kodokan.\n\n The sport of judo had entered Egypt for the first time in 1934 through Japanese experts to train the army and police forces at that time on the combat skills found in this sport in this sport, and in 1952 AD the International Judo Federation (I J F) was formed, in which so far more From a hundred countries, judo was accepted as an Olympic sport in 1964 at the Tokyo Olympic Games.`

When Jigoro Kano was eighteen years old in 1878, he gathered all the movements that the samurai class used to train in, which were called Jujutsu. He did this in the town of Shinorio under the supervision of two men named Fukuda and Iso, who held high positions in the Military Academy, which was completed in 1895 in Kyoto, Japan. Kano arranged and eliminated the dangerous and deadly movements, analyzed them, and identified the main points of how to teach these movements to the general public in a special school. That school was the Kodokan, which we mentioned earlier was established in 1882 in Tokyo, Japan. \n\n The Kodokan is the place where people come from all over the world for education and training, and to know everything new about the sport of Judo, because of the presence of high-level experiences from teachers and trainers who can consolidate and refine these experiences among the arrivals to the Kodokan.\n\n The sport of judo had entered Egypt for the first time in 1934 through Japanese experts to train the army and police forces at that time on the combat skills found in this sport in this sport, and in 1952 AD the International Judo Federation (I J F) was formed, in which so far more From a hundred countries, judo was accepted as an Olympic sport in 1964 at the Tokyo Olympic Games.',
